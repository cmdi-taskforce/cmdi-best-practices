X1: Include a reference to the profile XSD generated by the Component Registry

\priority{high}\clarinb{6.6}\checker{CMDI Instance Validator}

For each profile stored in the Component Registry a dynamically generated XSD is available. The URL of this XSD is available in the Info dialogue of a profile and should be included in the schemaLocation attribute on the CMD root element. This enables validation of a CMD record by general XSD validators, including the CMDI Validator. The Component Registry URL should be used as it ensures that fixes in the
transformation from a profile specification into an XSD are included in the validation process.

X2: Use common namespace prefixes

\priority{low}\checker{CMDI Instance Validator}

Namespace prefixes are officially just syntactic sugar in XML, i.e., provide a convenient shortcut. However, using common prefixes enable users to quickly assess the scope of an element. The CMDI 1.2 specification recommends the following prefixes for the namespaces URIs in CMDI as described in Table~\vref{table:namespaces}.

\begin{sidewaystable}
\caption{Namespaces}
\label{table:namespaces}
\begin{tabu} to 1.0\textwidth {|X[1,l]|X[2,l]|X[1,l]|X[1,l]|}
    \hline
     \textbf{Prefix} & \textbf{Namespace Name} & \textbf{Comment} & \textbf{Recommended Syntax} \\ \hline
     cmd & \makecell[l]{\tt{http://www.clarin.eu/cmd/1}} & CMDI instance (general/envelope) & prefixed \\ \hline
     cmdp & \makecell[l]{\tt{http://www.clarin.eu/cmd/1} \\\tt{/profiles/\{profileid\}}} & CMDI payload (profile specific) & prefixed \\ \hline
     cue & \makecell[l]{\tt{http://www.clarin.eu/cmd/cues/1}} & Cues for tools & prefixed \\ \hline
     xs & \makecell[l]{\tt{http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema}} & XML Schema & prefixed \\ \hline
     xsi & \makecell[l]{\tt{http://www.w3.org} \\\tt{/2001/XMLSchema-Instance}} & XML Schema Instance & prefixed \\ \hline
\end{tabu}
\end{sidewaystable}
See section \nameref{authoring-workflow} regarding validation, which implies well-formed XML.

X4: Specify encoding

\priority{high}

The encoding of XML documents, i.e., a CMD record doesn't have to be stated explicitly. It can be provided in various, possibly conflicting ways: via a Byte Order Marker (BOM), in the XML declaration of the document or a HTTP header. Also it is possible to not specify the encoding at all. This results in the risk that a processing application has to guess the encoding or fallback to some default, which may cause all kinds of conversion problems. The best practice is thus to always include the used encoding in the XML declaration, as shown in the following code snippet.

\lstset{language=XML}
\begin{lstlisting}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<cmd:CMD ... > ... </cmd:CMD>
\end{lstlisting}

All other used methods, e.g., HTTP headers provided by the web server, should be aligned with the encoding thus specified.

X3: Use UTF-8 encoding

\priority{high}

UTF-8\cite{rfc3629} is widely supported and a record that uses it thus has a very low risk of being mangled by encoding conversion problems.
