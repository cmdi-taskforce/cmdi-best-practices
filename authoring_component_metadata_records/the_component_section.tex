CS1: Provide extensive metadata with regard to the profile

\priority{medium}

In general, it should be aimed at providing `complete' metadata information with regard to the selected profile, i.e.~the information asked for by the profile's components, elements etc. should be provided as exhaustively as possible. In case optional elements of the selected profile are not assigned values, those elements should be left out of the metadata instance, i.e.~empty elements without metadata information either as element or attribute values should be avoided.

\subsubsection{Resource proxy
references}\label{resource-proxy-references}

\label{cs2}
CS2: refer to a ResourceProxy for resource specific metadata components

\priority{medium}

It is possible to refer to the resource a Components section
specifically applies to by including the respective Resource Proxy id in the \texttt{@cmd:ref} attribute of the component's root element. Don't refer back to all Resource Proxies, which is possible with CMDI 1.1, as this is the implicit default.

\subsubsection{Text Elements and Attributes} \label{text-elements-attributes}

CS7: always provide core metadata in English
\priority{high} \bptodo{TODO check: CMDI Instance Validator

\url{https://github.com/clarin-eric/cmdi-toolkit/issues/10}}

\bptodo{TODO: these out-of order BP numbers are not so nice, maybe switch to mnemonics, e.g., CS-en en CS-lang ... but I think we already had these in an earlier version.}
\bptodo{TODO: we have some other phrase for "core metadata" ... lookup}

It is preferred that English wording is provided for each element of the CMDI profile used. However, if this is not possible core textual metadata elements, i.e., title and description, should be available in English. 

\label{cs3}
CS3: Explicitly name the languages used
\priority{high} \bptodo{TODO check: CMDI Instance Validator

\url{https://github.com/clarin-eric/cmdi-toolkit/issues/11}}

\bptodo{TODO: the components section in modelling should also encourage multilinguality, maybe in C10}

The default language for element contents is English (see \hyperref[cs7]{CS7}). Additionally, other languages may be used, complementing the English version of a CMDI record. The possibility of multilinguality has to be already included in the design of the component. For the specification of the language applied, each element should be provided with an \texttt{@xml:lang} attribute (even when the content is in
English). Use a \href{https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt}{BCP 47 language tag} \cite{bcp47} to unambiguously identify the respective language within \texttt{@xml:lang}.

For elements that use vocabulary entries translations in other languages then English can be indirectly specified by language specific labels in the vocabulary.

CS4: Use specific rather than (only) generic metadata

\priority{medium}

\bptodo{TODO: Separate best practice on not using string concatenation for multi-valued content. Old smell covering this: 

  Occurrence of multiple values in a single string. For example multiple element values separated by commas, semicolons or other characters. In general it is better to use repeating elements, or use separate elements if the individual values have different semantics (for example resource type ``English literature -- Middle English'').
}
\note{Twan: Just an example of how generic and specific can be combine: example genre literature + genre crime novel would actually be helpful in terms of discoverability - unless the value comes from an ontology that allows us to derive such information, but this generally will not be the case.}
The information provided should be specific rather than generic
(e.g.~two items ``\texttt{gesture}'' and ``\texttt{speech}'' for modality would be preferred to one item ``\texttt{multimodal}''). Similarly, there should be exactly one value per element. In case of several suitable values use several elements accordingly (e.g.~prefer
\texttt{\textless{}modality\textgreater{}gesture\textless{}/modality\textgreater{}\textless{}modality\textgreater{}speech\textless{}/modality\textgreater{}} to \texttt{\textless{}modality\textgreater{}gesture,\ speech\textless{}/modality\textgreater{}}). Note: In cases where controlled vocabularies are provided, the values are governed by those. However, also when metadata creators are free to type any string, it is best practice to avoid assigning enumerations of (what is generally perceived as) distinct values to one and the same element or attribute.

\subsubsection{Vocabularies}\label{vocabularies}

CS5: In open vocabularies make use of the suggested items before introducing extensions

\priority{medium} \bptodo{partially check: CMDI Instance Validator}

In case of an open vocabulary provided for an element or attribute the proposed vocabulary should be applied wherever possible and only extended in case of gaps with regard to contents/concepts. If the proposed vocabulary is extended, try to avoid overlapping meanings and ambiguities among vocabulary items.

\note{Menzo: Turn into a separate BP: ``If a suggested value is taken for an element and a concept link is available in the vocabulary, the link should be copied into the \texttt{@cmd:ValueConceptLink}''}

\label{cs6}
CS6: Provide consistent vocabulary items

\priority{medium}

The vocabulary used should be consistent throughout a repository. In this standardised wording and spelling (e.g.~for named entities such as organisations, collections, etc.) should be used and abbreviations should be avoided or provided together with their proper expansion. Items of the vocabulary used should be mutually exclusive so that they hence may be unambiguously applied.
